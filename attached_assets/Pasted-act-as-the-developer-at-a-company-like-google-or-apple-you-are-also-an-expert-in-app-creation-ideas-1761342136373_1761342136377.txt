act as the developer at a company like google or apple, you are also an expert in app creation ideas that become extremely successful. using your expertise create an app that will generate a passive income and is scalible

Please integrate the following Zoer built-in features:

File Upload for uploading files
Stripe Payment for payment processing
AI Image Generation for generating images from text
Authentication for user login, registration, and session management
Database for data storage and management
I'll design a scalable passive income app that leverages all the powerful Zoer built-in features. Based on my experience analyzing successful apps, I'm proposing a "Brand Kit AI" platform - a SaaS tool that helps small businesses and entrepreneurs create professional brand assets using AI.

Why this will succeed:

Recurring Revenue Model: Subscription-based with tiered pricing (freemium → pro → enterprise)
Low Marginal Cost: AI generation scales infinitely without inventory
High Demand Market: 33M+ small businesses in US alone need branding
Network Effects: User-generated templates become marketplace assets
Viral Growth: Watermarked free tier drives organic acquisition
Monetization Strategy:

Free Tier: 5 AI generations/month (watermarked)
Pro Tier: $29/month - unlimited generations, no watermark, premium templates
Enterprise Tier: $99/month - team collaboration, brand guidelines, API access
Marketplace: 20% commission on user-created template sales
Scalability Path:

Phase 1: Individual creators (launch)
Phase 2: Small business teams (3-6 months)
Phase 3: Agency white-label (12 months)
Phase 4: API for third-party integrations (18 months)
Let me create the detailed requirements draft:
